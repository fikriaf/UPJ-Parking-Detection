The dataset includes 23 images.
Objects are annotated in YOLOv12 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fill (with center crop))
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)
* Auto-contrast via histogram equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
